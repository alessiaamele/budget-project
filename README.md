# My Application

## Brief
In short, this is tool that helps the user to plan and budget his/her favourite home-prepared meals on a weekly basis. The purpose is to help the user to know what he/she is eating. It will have the following features:
* a seven-day calendar in which to insert up to 5 meals a day
* the possibility of inserting a recipe and a description of the meal, as well as the ingredients, time to prepare, and health levels
* the possibility of saving and storing in the back log different recipes with the associated list of ingredients (major ingredients and minor ingredients)
* a calculation of the approximate cost of all the ingredients required so that we can know the cost of each recipe

More specifically, the application will have 3 databases:
* a **meal table** for which the user will specify for each of his favourite and most used dishes the following:
   * name of the recipe/dish
   * list of ingredients (high importance/low importance/spices) and associated estimated prices
   * description on the recipe/ notes that the user can make
   * time to prepare
   * other tags such as health rating or protein
* a **ingredient table**, in which we can plan which meal we are going to have and when
  * a seven-day calendar in which to insert up to 5 meals/dishes a day
  * possibility of saving data on previous weeks
* possibly a **budget table**, in which we will be able to track how much the meal will cost
  * a seven-day calendar in which we get a list of ingredients & cost used each day,
  * a calculation of the approximate cost of a meal, of a day and of a week of groceries
  * possibility of saving data on previous weeks



### Additional requirements
* It would be nice to have a feature of ideas for recipes with similar ingredients, connected to an API / "what to do with leftovers"
* Some meals will require half a unit of an ingredient (eg: half a can of tomato sauce) -> brainstorm ideas to monitor this and include it in the costs, such as for example an additional feature of the meals would be tracking the leftovers? or a tag that shows recipes we can make using the leftovers?
* Also think about the number of people that are going to eat (for the cost of ingredients) - 1 person/ 2 people/ a household
